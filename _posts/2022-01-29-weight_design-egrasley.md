## A Weight on my Shoulders

Work this week primarily consisted of motor characterization and design of the enclosure and mount for the controller. A UWaterloo student lab is being used for access to the oscilloscopes and power supplies needed to find the motor voltage/torque constant, armature resistance/inductance, and rotor inertia/friction. An issue arose where the digital tachometer could not accurately read the speed of the shaft on out motor, so I will be going back in with a 3D printed pulley to increase the size of the shaft. 

Design was finished on the controller enclosure/mounting system. A laser cut acrylic plate will be used as a surface to bolt control system components down to. The plate will have mounting holes cut and a general-purpose plastic bin will be used as an enclosure. This enclosure will also have mounting holes cut. Finally, a small backpack will be used to hold the enclosure and allow the user to wear it. Holes will be cut in the backpack and M6 nuts/bolts used to secure everything together. Hopefully, a smaller enclosure than the one shown below can be found.
