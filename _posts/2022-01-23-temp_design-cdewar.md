## Not so (Short) Circuit Diagrams

The temperature feedback progressed well over the last week. In-line fuses for the Buck converters were bought and will be installed the following week. These fuses are used to cut power in the case of a short circuit. This will prevent the heaters/cooler from being kept or from both being on at the same time (since the current draw if heating and cooling is more than the fuse is rated for).

Additionally, the temerature circuit wiring was completed and was handed off to Emily Studzinski to be installed in the glove.
