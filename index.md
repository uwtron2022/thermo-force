## The Future of Virtual Reality
<hr>
Virtual reality (VR) is an extremely promising technology, one bordering on science fiction levels of futurism, that is 
not being utilized as well as it could be. We're trying to change that! 

> VR is a way to escape the real world into something more fantastic. It has the potential to be the most social 
> technology of all time

## The Project
<hr>
This project is being completed as the teams Fourth Year Design Project. This is a yearlong culminating project that all students at the University of Waterloo take part in. The goal of the project is to take an idea from inception wo working prototype in the span of 8 months. 

The focus of our project is low-cost inclusion of novel VR feedback types to realize the full potential of VR. We are realizing this goal by creating a VR system with temperature and weight feedback! 

## The Product
<hr>
Our product allows users to reach new levels of immersion in any type of VR game. This is done with a glove that, when connected to any VR system, can track the user’s hands and automatically provide temperature and weight feedback.
