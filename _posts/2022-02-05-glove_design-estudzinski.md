## A Whole New Meaning to “Cable Knit”

Glove fabrication concluded this week with the addition of the electronic components to the fabric glove base! Cable management and testing will follow soon. The thermistors were sewn on and will be secured more thoroughly once electronic testing concludes. The heating pads were adhered to the metal pads using a thin layer of a flexible silicone adhesive, and additional straps were added to the glove to secure the Peltier plate/heat sink combination (as a bonus: it is easily removable if need be). Future adjustments to the glove will be made on an as-needed basis, depending on how testing and integration goes.
