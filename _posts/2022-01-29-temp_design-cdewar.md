## Extreme Cold Warning, not Just Local

Work this week primarily consisted of determining the wiring layout and lengths that will be required to connect the batteries to the buck converters and then the buck converters to the circuit boards and Arduino. Controller temperature code will be hopefully updated and finalized early next week with the completion of glove sewing and mounting of the heaters, coolers and thermistors. After physical layout is completed the temperature control code can be finished.
