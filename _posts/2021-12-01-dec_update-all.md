# Project Progress - December 2021

December saw the completion of the first semester of this design project. There were several deliverables completed during the first two weeks of the month. These include logbooks detailing the past four months work, plans and schedules for the next four months of work, and a final report encapsulating the entire projects work from the beginning of September to the end of November. This includes topic selection, design generation and selection, project constrains/objectives/criteria, calculations/simulations/proof of concepts, and preliminary schedules for the next four months.
