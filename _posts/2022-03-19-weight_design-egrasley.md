Thankfully, there was not much left to do this week. A satisfactory weight controller was completed on Monday, and final full system integration testing with the VR simulation was completed on Thursday. 

Friday was symposium, which is a daylong demonstration of what we have accomplished over the last 8 months. The day started at 9AM when we arrived and set up the system. It ran successfully for a full 6 hours off batteries, with only one recharge per battery needed. However, weight feedback was turned off after 2 hours to help conserve batteries, as the motor consumes most of the system power.
