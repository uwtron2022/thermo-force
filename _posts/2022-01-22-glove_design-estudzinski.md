## A Glove, Sewn, not Glued 

The glove sewing pattern and approach was finalized this week, complete with more detailed sketches explaining how the inner and outer layers peel away from each other. All required fabric/Velcro/snaps were purchased, and fabrication began. The inner layer is nearly complete, only requiring the electronics to be mounted and for a strip of Velcro to be attached so that the glove can close around the back of the user’s hand. This will be completed soon, and fabrication on the outer layer will begin.
