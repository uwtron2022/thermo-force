## A Strapping Young Lad

The remaining soft components were completed within the last couple of weeks. An arm strap was made for cable management, a wrist strap to attach the weight simulation cable to, and two thigh straps to attach the motor for the weight simulation to the user’s thighs. Each of these straps have several inches of adjustment to be able to accommodate various arm/wrist/thigh sizes effectively and comfortably and feature Velcro closures. This concludes soft component design and fabrication, with only slight adjustments foreseen in the future in the event of a seam/thread ripping or a size adjustment.
