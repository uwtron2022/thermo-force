## Frigid Ridgid 60” Tool

This week was a very successful week in terms of work completed.  After corresponding with RIDGID Canada, they agreed to send a drill and impact driver to assist with completing the electronics enclosure. The enclosure is now mostly completed – all circuit boards are now mounted on 3D printed base plates, and most components are now wired together.
