## Wires here, Wires there, Wires everywhere!

Software development for the temperature feedback system has been completed. The proof-of-concept code created earlier has been updated to include the final number of heaters and thermistors placed on the glove. An initial mounting baseplate for mounting the electronics components to was 3D printed. This plate will be mounted in a backpack in an enclosure, so everything moves with the user. Finally, the heating/cooling control relays and thermistor control blocks were labelled and validated based on the current state of the glove. Next week subsystem integration can hopefully begin.
