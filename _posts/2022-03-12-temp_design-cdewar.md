## Things are Heating Up! 

With only a week left before the symposium things were really heating up for the team. On Monday we demoed the system to our advisors, to show how the system works. 

This week a marketing video was also created to help promote the product. A copy of the video can be view here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z5I9yoPDuQdfU1XbgtHBxKy9weJSOhYl/view?usp=sharing. The video shows the various features of the product and how well all the components work together, which is exciting to see!
