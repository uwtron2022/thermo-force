## Not too Hot to Handle

Testing with the Leap Motion Controller was completed to ensure materials that are in the glove will not interfere with the Controller’s hand-tracking ability; cloth and PCB boards were used to ensure that material objects do not interfere with tracking and heating pads were used to ensure the infrared band emitted from the resistive heaters will not overlap with the infrared band used to track hand movement. 

In terms of game development, the Leap Motion Plugin for unity was used to allow hand-tracking to control objects in the game; the hands are now fully functional in the Unity scene. Finally, server-side scripts for communicating Bluetooth information is complete such that all relevant information can be sent to the controller.
