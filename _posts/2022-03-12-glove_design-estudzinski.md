## VelcrOh-No! (Just Kidding, Everything is Alright)

ecause all soft components were completed last week, this week was focused on testing and demoing. The parts hold up well. The thigh straps are comfortable, especially with the pockets of padding that were included between the user’s leg and the metal mounting bar. The wrist strap could be more comfortable, but we are focusing on other priorities. The only real adjustment that had to be done was adding more Velcro (the loop side) to the thigh straps to allow them to go tighter than originally designed. Three inches were added to both straps.
