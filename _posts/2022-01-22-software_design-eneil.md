## Head in the Game, Even without a VR Headset 

Minimum viable product (MVP) of the game development was completed this week! These milestones include setting up a Virtual Reality game in Unity that has: a ‘hot’ object, a ‘cold’ object and objects of varying mass. Additionally, the leap motion sensor is used in a first-person context to control these objects. From here, we can further develop the game to make a visually pleasing and fun user experience. Next up from here, is integrating a Bluetooth connection with the Arduino such that the game environment and controls can communicate!
