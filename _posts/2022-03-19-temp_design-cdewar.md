## Capstone – Symposium

Luckly there was not much left to do this week as the Capstone Symposium was Friday! The temperature controller was working well and met or surpassed all the specifications laid out. 

Friday the symposium happened which was a daylong demonstration of what we have accomplished over the last two terms. It was a full day event which consisted of the morning full of setup and testing and the afternoon of demonstrating the product to various judges and students. We also created a test jig that was able to hold the motor, leap motion as well as the backpack in place which was helpful to show it off to all the various students and groups.
