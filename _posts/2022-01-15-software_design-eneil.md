# No Escaping Web Dev

Game development has begun on the Unity Platform with the Leap Motion developer plugin for compatibility with the infrared hand tracker. MVP (minimum viable product) goals for the game is to have an object with weight, an object that is ‘hot’ and object that is ‘cold’. Meeting with the temperature/weight feedback teams to follow to declare exactly what information is to be sent over Bluetooth to the Arduino, and in what format. Website development for basic scaffolding is complete, with ongoing iterative changes to project/product descriptions, photos, logos, blog posts, etc. Website uses Github.io pages and is live as of Jan 13, 2022.
