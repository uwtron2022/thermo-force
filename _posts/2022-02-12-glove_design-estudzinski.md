## A Hand in Heat

The glove was tested this week with the electronics powered on. The glove is comfortable, and any temperature changes (via the resistive heaters and Peltier plate) are readily felt through it within reason. More testing is required to improve hand tracking capabilities, as the glove does not track as well as a bare human hand does.  

In terms of other soft components that need to be made, a wrist and thigh strap were designed to hold the weight simulation cable and motor respectively. Fabrication of these parts will start in the next couple of weeks. The image attached shows the conceptual design for the thigh strap, with the mounting bar cropped for simplicity.
