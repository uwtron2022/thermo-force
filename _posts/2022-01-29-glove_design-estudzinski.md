## Thready or Knot, here it Comes

The construction of the glove hit a major progress milestone this week with the completion of the fabric body! The inner and outer layers are both complete and have been sewn together, with snaps that can come undone to partially peel away the layers if access to electronics is needed. There are strong Velcro connections at the back palm and at each of the four fingers and thumb to allow for fine adjustments to the size. Most of the hand’s range of motion has been maintained, although the conduction-assisting layers of thermal padding and metal can cause some additional stiffness at the base of the fingers. 

The next step is to mount the electronics to the glove and add any other snaps/fastenings as needed to help keep the electronics and cables in place. Once that is complete, we can move to testing.
