The primary goals of the glove design are to hold the active heating/cooling elements close to the user’s skin and to provide as much adjustment and comfort as possible. Although the exact glove design is currently being finalized and prototyped, the basic components consist of cotton fabric for the base, thermal padding and thin strips of aluminum to assist with heat transfer, and Velcro/snaps for an adjustable size. Ideally, the design will also consist of a detachable inner and outer layer that will allow the glove to be easily opened if the electronic components require attention and will provide a cleaner appearance when the layers are combined, and the electronics are hidden. 

At the base of the glove will be a wrist strap where the cable for the weight simulation system can be attached. The attachment point will be designed to break if too high a force is experienced to protect the user from injury.
