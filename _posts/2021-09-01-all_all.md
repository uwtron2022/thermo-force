# Project Progress During September 2021

Project activities in September focused on project setup. This includes determining what the project focus should be, determining meeting times, setting up file storage structures, and determining primary project areas for team members. The project focus was determined by looking at the National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges for the 21st Century and selecting the topic that interested the team the most. VR (Virtual Reality) and its slow adoption was selected as the topic of interest and feasibility research was done to determine if the scope of a VR related project was appropriate for our FYDP. After determining a VR based project was feasible, a needs assessment was performed to determine a root cause issue to focus on for the duration of this project. After selecting a final area to focus on (lack of feedback for non-visual/smell-based senses) possible solutions were discusses/generated and a final design selected. This design is the glove-based temperature and weight feedback, with infrared hand-tracking design seen in later posts.
