## Reading Week, you mean Working Week! 

The week of Feb 20th saw the test fitting and full assembly of temperature feedback components inside the control box. This included mounting and testing with the batteries. There was also some work finished on the poster for symposium, based on the template provided in learn.  

This past week saw physical completion of the full system assembly, as shown in the following figures. The system performed as expected, and some minor tuning will be done before our final design meeting on Monday. The entire system should be put together with the hand tracking on Sunday using the leap motion and unity based VR game.
